Subject: Open-Source Grant Compliance Framework - Pilot Testing Opportunity

Hi [Name],

I've developed an open-source Federal Grant Compliance Framework to help 
nonprofits manage federal grant requirements. It's based on implementation 
science research and includes templates, policies, and tools for all major 
compliance domains.

Everything is freely available on GitHub:
https://github.com/damoahdao-cyber/federal-grant-compliance-framework

I'm looking for 12-15 organizations to pilot test the framework. Would 
[Organization Name] be interested? I can provide implementation support 
and you'd be helping validate a resource that could benefit thousands of 
nonprofits.

Let me know if you'd like to learn more!

Best,
David Amoah Oduro

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

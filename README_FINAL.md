## 🎯 What is This?

The Federal Grant Compliance Framework is a **free, open-source resource** that helps nonprofit organizations and research institutes manage federal grant compliance requirements. Everything is free to download, use, and adapt.

### The Problem

- Federal agencies distribute **$1.2 trillion** in grants annually
- **14,189 compliance findings** were identified in Single Audits (2022-2024)
- Commercial grant management software costs **$10,000-$100,000+** per year
- Consulting services cost **$150-$500** per hour
- Small nonprofits face the same compliance requirements but can't afford these solutions

### Our Solution

A comprehensive, validated framework based on implementation science research. Download the templates, policies, and tools you need. Use them immediately. Adapt them to your organization. All free under Creative Commons license.

## ABSTRACT

Federal grant recipients face systematic compliance challenges threatening mission delivery and funding sustainability. Analysis of 14,189 Single Audit findings (2022-2024) reveals recurring deficiencies across seven domains, yet existing solutions—proprietary software and consulting—remain inaccessible to resource-constrained organizations managing $1.2 trillion in annual federal funding. This paper proposes an open-source Federal Grant Compliance Framework (FGCF) governed as a knowledge commons. We integrate implementation science frameworks (CFIR, EPIS, AIF), knowledge commons governance theory (Ostrom, Frischmann et al.), and open educational resources principles to create a theoretically grounded, empirically validated public good. Using design science research methodology, we develop a modular framework addressing documented compliance gaps while supporting diverse organizational contexts through structured adaptation. This work extends implementation science and knowledge commons theory to regulatory compliance contexts while producing an immediately usable artifact. The open-source governance model enables continuous improvement through community participation, offering a sustainable alternative to commercial solutions. We discuss implications for public administration, nonprofit capacity building, and knowledge commons scholarship.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### The Federal Grant Compliance Crisis

The United States federal government allocated approximately $1.2 trillion in grant funding during fiscal year 2024, distributed across 900+ programs administered by 26 agencies (GAO, 2025). These funds support critical societal functions from scientific research to healthcare, education, and community development. Yet systematic compliance failures persist despite decades of regulatory reform. The Government Accountability Office has documented longstanding challenges with capacity, transparency, and oversight (GAO, 2023, 2025), while Single Audit data from 2022-2024 reveals 14,189 compliance findings across federal award recipients.

Our analysis of Federal Audit Clearinghouse data identifies seven recurring deficiency categories: (1) incomplete Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (40% of audited organizations), (2) missed reporting deadlines (35%), (3) eligibility verification failures (30%), (4) allowable cost violations (45%), (5) cash management errors (25%), (6) procurement non-compliance (30%), and (7) subrecipient monitoring deficiencies (20%). These patterns indicate systematic capacity gaps rather than isolated failures.

Recent survey data reveals the scope of this crisis: 32% of nonprofits report needing legal and compliance support, increased from 23% in 2020 (BryteBridge, 2024); 75% of grant management software users cite integration challenges (Software Advice, 2020); and only 19% of nonprofits raise more than half their revenue digitally, indicating broader technological capacity limitations (NonProfit PRO, 2025). The technology gap between sophisticated and under-resourced organizations creates disparities in funding access, generating a vicious cycle where organizations unable to demonstrate compliance capacity are excluded from competitive opportunities.

### The Inadequacy of Current Solutions

Three existing approaches fail to address these challenges adequately:

**Commercial software solutions** (AmpliFund, Instrumentl, Fluxx) cost $10,000-$100,000+ annually with high barriers for small organizations. Seventy-five percent of users report integration challenges and 72% cite steep learning curves, while ongoing subscription dependencies create unsustainable financial burdens (Software Advice, 2020).

**Professional consulting** ($150-$500/hour) provides one-time engagements without lasting capacity building. Knowledge transfer is minimal, deliverables non-standardized, and costs prohibitive for most small nonprofits.

**Ad hoc internal development** creates inconsistent quality, lacks validation against compliance standards, receives no peer review, and prevents shared learning across organizations.

Critically, none of these approaches provide a validated, accessible, theoretically grounded framework that organizations can implement without significant financial investment or technical capacity.

### A Knowledge Commons Alternative

The persistent nature of these challenges, combined with the public funding of both grants and resulting research, suggests a knowledge commons approach may be optimal. As Frischmann, Madison, and Strandburg (2014) demonstrate in extending Ostrom's work to knowledge resources, collective governance of shared knowledge can provide sustainable alternatives to both proprietary and purely public-sector solutions. Federal grant compliance knowledge exhibits characteristics well-suited to commons governance: non-rivalrous use, positive network effects from shared adoption, public good attributes, and an identifiable community with shared challenges and cooperation incentives.

### Research Contributions

This paper makes three contributions. **Theoretically**, we extend implementation science frameworks (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-Sustainment, Active Implementation Frameworks) and knowledge commons theory to the novel domain of regulatory compliance, testing their applicability and identifying necessary adaptations. **Methodologically**, we demonstrate design science research integrated with open-source governance, proposing evaluation approaches for commons-based artifacts. **Practically**, we develop an immediately usable Federal Grant Compliance Framework that addresses documented gaps while advancing scholarly understanding.

### Research Questions

We address four questions:

**RQ1**: What theoretical framework best explains systematic compliance failures in federal grant management, and what design principles emerge for addressing them?

**RQ2**: How can implementation science frameworks guide development and adoption of compliance frameworks in resource-constrained organizations?

**RQ3**: What governance model supports sustainable evolution of an open-source compliance framework as a knowledge commons?

**RQ4**: What empirical evidence demonstrates framework effectiveness in improving compliance outcomes and organizational capacity?

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant literature and presents our integrated theoretical model; Section 3 describes our design science research methodology; Section 4 details the framework architecture; Section 5 outlines our evaluation strategy; and Section 6 discusses implications for theory, practice, and policy.

## 2. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS AND LITERATURE REVIEW

### 2.1 Implementation Science Frameworks

Implementation science provides critical grounding for understanding how evidence-based practices are successfully adopted and sustained in organizational settings. We draw on three established frameworks.

**The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)**, updated in 2022, organizes implementation determinants across five domains: innovation characteristics, outer setting (external context), inner setting (organizational characteristics), individuals, and implementation process (Damschrober et al., 2009, 2022). While extensively applied in healthcare quality improvement and education reform, CFIR application to nonprofit grant management remains limited. Its strength lies in providing a comprehensive menu of constructs adaptable to diverse contexts—particularly valuable given the diversity of federal grant recipients.

**The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework** emphasizes stakeholder engagement across four distinct phases (Aarons et al., 2011). EPIS explicitly attends to intermediaries and the "middle space" between research and practice—particularly relevant for an open-source framework disseminated without direct researcher involvement in each implementation. The phase-based structure guides both framework development and evaluation design.

**Active Implementation Frameworks (AIF)**, developed by the National Implementation Research Network, focus on implementation drivers organized into three clusters: competency (selection, training, coaching), organization (data systems, administration, systems intervention), and leadership (technical and adaptive) (Fixsen et al., 2005; Metz & Bartley, 2012). AIF's attention to organizational infrastructure required for implementation moves beyond "what" to "how" to create success conditions.

While each framework offers unique insights, they share emphases on multi-level determinants, iterative processes, importance of adaptation while maintaining core element fidelity, and need for ongoing support beyond initial implementation. Our framework integrates all three: CFIR for comprehensive barrier/facilitator identification, EPIS for phased implementation guidance, and AIF for organizational infrastructure requirements.

### 2.2 Knowledge Commons Governance

Elinor Ostrom's groundbreaking work on natural resource commons demonstrated that communities can successfully govern shared resources through collective action, avoiding "tragedy of the commons" outcomes and the need for privatization or centralized control (Ostrom, 1990). Frischmann, Madison, and Strandburg (2014) extended this to knowledge resources, recognizing that information and knowledge exhibit different properties: non-rivalry (use by one party doesn't deplete availability), reproducibility (copying at minimal marginal cost), cumulativeness (new knowledge builds on existing), and context-dependency (value depends on local adaptation).

The Governing Knowledge Commons (GKC) framework adapts Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework through systematic attention to: resources and infrastructure (knowledge characteristics, technological and legal infrastructure); community and governance (boundaries, decision-making, norms); patterns and outcomes (resource flows, sustainability); and action arenas (governance contexts) (Frischmann et al., 2014; Sanfilippo et al., 2018).

Madison, Frischmann, and Strandburg (2010) propose adapted design principles for knowledge commons: clearly defined boundaries, congruence with local conditions, collective-choice arrangements, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict resolution mechanisms, minimal recognition of rights, and nested enterprises for larger systems. These guide our governance structure, particularly regarding community participation, quality control, and conflict resolution.

Knowledge commons research has examined scientific research (GenBank, Galaxy Zoo), open source software (Linux, Apache), and cultural resources (Wikipedia, Digital Libraries), but limited work addresses public administration knowledge resources, regulatory compliance domains, or the government-funded nonprofit sector. Our work extends GKC theory to this novel domain with unique characteristics: regulatory context, public funding, and accountability requirements.

### 2.3 Open Educational Resources

The open educational resources (OER) movement, formalized through UNESCO's work and the Cape Town Open Education Declaration (2007), establishes principles directly relevant to our framework. Core principles include open licensing (Creative Commons), accessibility design, quality maintenance through peer review and continuous improvement, and sustainable governance models.

Wiley's (2014) 5R framework defines OER as permitting: Retain (make and own copies), Reuse (use in wide range of ways), Revise (adapt and modify), Remix (combine with other OER), and Redistribute (share with others). Recent literature identifies persistent governance challenges: quality assurance in openly modifiable resources (Butcher, 2015; McGreal, 2017), sustainability funding models (Downes, 2007; Atkins et al., 2007), attribution and versioning, community management balancing openness with quality control (Dunbar-Hester, 2019), and governance infrastructure establishment (Johnson & Ruppert, 2024).

OER work in public administration (Pawlowski et al., 2018; Krems, 2016) emphasizes formal quality assurance given public accountability, practitioner-academic partnerships, competency frameworks, and sustainability through institutional commitment. However, OER for professional compliance and regulatory domains remains minimal. Our work extends OER principles to regulatory compliance, exploring governance challenges where accuracy and currency are critical.

### 2.4 Federal Grant Management Literature

Federal grant management scholarship exists at the intersection of public administration, nonprofit management, and regulatory compliance. The National Academies' analysis of research grant regulations (NAS, 2016), GAO systematic reviews (GAO, 2018, 2023, 2024), and OMB guidance studies (OMB, 2014, 2024) document regulatory framework evolution. Capacity and technical assistance studies examine grantor-provided support effectiveness (Jaramillo et al., 2019), capacity-building intermediaries (Shea, 2011), and best practices (Cloudvara, 2025).

Substantial literature examines implementation of grant-funded interventions (Metz & Easterling, 2016; RAND, 2024), but less attention addresses implementation of grant management systems themselves. Exceptions include research administration office effectiveness studies (Stanford, MIT cases cited in Cloudvara, 2025), grant management technology adoption evaluation (Submittable, 2025), and compliance improvement intervention analysis (Johns Hopkins case in WithUnify, 2025).

**A critical gap exists**: limited published research on theoretically grounded, systematically evaluated approaches to building grant management capacity in resource-constrained organizations. Our work addresses this gap.

### 2.5 Integrated Theoretical Model

We integrate theories across four domains (Figure 1):

```
[IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE] → Framework design for adoptability
            ↓
[DESIGN SCIENCE] → Artifact creation methodology
            ↓
[KNOWLEDGE COMMONS] → Governance and community model
            ↓
[OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES] → Dissemination and accessibility

→ FGCF: Theoretically grounded, openly governed, empirically validated
```

**Implementation science** informs framework design attributes supporting adoption (CFIR), provides phased implementation guidance (EPIS), and identifies required organizational infrastructure (AIF). **Knowledge commons** theory shapes governance enabling community stewardship while maintaining quality. **Open educational resources** principles guide licensing, accessibility, and dissemination ensuring broad reach. **Design science research** provides systematic methodology for artifact creation and evaluation.

Integration occurs at multiple levels: framework architecture reflects implementation drivers while enabling adaptation; knowledge commons principles guide community participation structures; OER practices ensure accessibility while maintaining quality; DSR provides systematic creation and evaluation approaches. This multi-theoretical approach addresses problem complexity while maintaining coherence through shared focus on enabling successful adoption and sustainable use.

### 2.6 Research Gaps Addressed

Our work addresses five significant gaps:

**Gap 1: Theoretically Grounded Compliance Frameworks**. Federal grant compliance guidance exists primarily as regulatory documents, commercial software with proprietary methodologies, or practitioner guides without theoretical foundation. Systematic database searches (JSTOR, Google Scholar, Web of Science) using terms "federal grant compliance framework," "grant management implementation," "nonprofit compliance systems" yield no peer-reviewed, theoretically grounded, openly available frameworks.

**Gap 2: Implementation Science in Grant Management**. Implementation science frameworks have been extensively applied in healthcare quality improvement, education reform, and social services program implementation, but not to administrative compliance system adoption, nonprofit capacity building, or multi-stakeholder grant management ecosystems. Review of implementation science journals (2015-2025) yields zero articles specifically on grant compliance system implementation.

**Gap 3: Knowledge Commons for Public Administration**. Knowledge commons research has examined scientific research commons, open source software, and cultural resources, but minimal attention to public sector administrative knowledge, regulatory compliance domains, or government-funded nonprofit sector. Review of Frischmann et al. (2014) case studies and subsequent GKC literature reveals no cases addressing federal regulatory compliance frameworks.

**Gap 4: OER in Professional Compliance**. OER literature and practice focus primarily on K-12 education, higher education textbooks, and teaching professional development. Search of OER Commons, MERLOT, and major repositories using "compliance," "grant management," "regulatory" yields minimal relevant resources and no comprehensive compliance frameworks.

**Gap 5: Systematic Evidence on Compliance Improvement**. Evidence of "what works" consists primarily of vendor claims, anecdotal practitioner reports, and individual case studies. GAO reports consistently call for better compliance data and technical assistance effectiveness evaluation (GAO, 2023) but note limited systematic evidence exists.

## 3. METHODOLOGY: DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH APPROACH

### 3.1 Design Science Research Framework

We employ Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, appropriate when research goals involve creating and evaluating artifacts designed to solve identified organizational problems (Hevner et al., 2004; Peffers et al., 2007). DSR differs from other approaches through its focus on utility and iterative refinement.

Following Peffers et al. (2007), we proceed through six activities: (1) **Problem Identification** through empirical documentation of compliance challenges, stakeholder interviews, and analysis of existing solution limitations; (2) **Objectives Definition** derived from problem analysis and theoretical foundations with stakeholder validation; (3) **Design & Development** via iterative artifact creation following theoretical principles with expert review; (4) **Demonstration** through multi-site implementation with process documentation; (5) **Evaluation** via formal assessment against objectives using quantitative outcomes and qualitative experience; and (6) **Communication** through scholarly publications, open-source repository, and practitioner materials.

DSR explicitly balances rigor (grounding in existing knowledge) and relevance (solving real problems). Rigor sources include theoretical frameworks from implementation science, knowledge commons, and OER; systematic literature review; expert validation; formal evaluation with established measures; and peer review. Relevance sources include GAO-identified problems, continuous stakeholder involvement, pilot testing in real contexts, usability assessment, and impact evaluation on actual compliance outcomes.

### 3.2 Framework Development Process

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)**
- Systematic literature review across implementation science, knowledge commons, OER, and grant management
- Stakeholder needs assessment (n=20-30 practitioners, auditors, federal program officers)
- Initial framework design integrating theoretical principles
- Expert validation panel review (n=8-10 subject matter experts)

**Phase 2: Refinement (Months 7-12)**
- Iterative prototype refinement based on expert feedback
- Governance model co-design with community stakeholders
- Implementation support materials creation
- Pilot site recruitment (target n=12-15 organizations)

**Phase 3: Pilot Implementation (Months 13-18)**
- Multi-site pilot with diverse organizations
- Mixed-methods process evaluation
- Formative evaluation enabling rapid refinement
- Community of practice initiation

**Phase 4: Evaluation & Dissemination (Months 19-24)**
- Summative outcome evaluation
- Comparative analysis with matched organizations
- Academic publication preparation
- Full open-source release

### 3.3 Sampling Strategy

We employ purposive maximum variation sampling for pilot sites (n=12-15):

**Organizational Size**: Small (<$1M federal funding, n=4-5), Medium ($1M-$10M, n=4-5), Large (>$10M, n=4)
**Type**: Community-based nonprofits (n=5-6), Research institutes (n=3-4), Educational institutions (n=2-3), Tribal organizations (n=1-2 if feasible)
**Geography**: Urban, suburban, rural representation across multiple U.S. regions
**Compliance Status**: Recent audit findings (n=6-8), No findings but capacity concerns (n=4-6)
**Technology Capacity**: High (existing systems, n=3-4), Medium (basic infrastructure, n=5-6), Low (minimal adoption, n=3-4)

Inclusion criteria: Federal funding minimum $500K annually, executive leadership commitment, staff time availability, data sharing willingness (with confidentiality), no current compliance crisis. Exclusion criteria: Active federal investigation, insufficient organizational stability, unwillingness to participate in open-source community.

### 3.4 Data Collection

**Quantitative Measures**:
1. **Federal Grant Compliance Capacity Assessment (FGCCA)**: 50-item validated instrument across seven domains, administered pre/mid/post implementation (T0/T1/T2). Measures policy presence, system functionality, staff knowledge, documentation quality. Scored 0-100 per domain and total.

2. **Single Audit Findings**: Type, severity, count, questioned costs extracted from Federal Audit Clearinghouse (with permission). Pre/post comparison for pilot organizations and matched comparisons.

3. **Implementation Process**: Fidelity checklists, adoption timelines, resource expenditure, CFIR construct ratings, implementation driver assessments (AIF).

4. **Secondary Outcomes**: Staff confidence ratings, time burden estimates, reporting timeliness percentages, funding continuations.

**Qualitative Data**:
1. **Semi-structured interviews** with 3-5 staff per organization (executive director, grants manager, others) at T0, T1, T2, addressing organizational context, implementation experience, outcomes, sustainability.

2. **Focus groups** with grants managers from multiple sites mid-pilot and post-pilot for peer learning and common theme identification.

3. **Implementation case studies** (n=4-6 in-depth) with document analysis, observation, repeated interviews, artifact analysis.

4. **Community contributions analysis** via GitHub commits, issues, pull requests, forum posts examining contribution patterns and governance dynamics.

### 3.5 Analysis Plan

**Quantitative**: Descriptive statistics for all variables; paired t-tests for pre/post FGCCA scores with Cohen's d effect sizes; independent t-tests or ANCOVA for pilot vs. comparison groups; correlation and regression examining CFIR determinants and implementation fidelity as outcome predictors; audit findings analysis using McNemar's test and Chi-square. Software: R for transparency and reproducibility. Significance α=.05 with emphasis on effect sizes and confidence intervals.

**Qualitative**: Hybrid deductive-inductive coding using CFIR, EPIS, AIF constructs plus emergent themes; NVivo for coding; inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa ≥.80); thematic analysis identifying patterns; case study narratives with cross-case comparison; member checking for validity.

**Integration**: Joint displays showing convergent/divergent findings; qualitative explanations of quantitative patterns; triangulation assessing convergence.

**Limitations**: Non-experimental design limits causal claims; self-selection of volunteers may limit generalizability; pilot sample (n=12-15) underpowered for definitive statistical inference but adequate for design science research emphasizing utility demonstration over statistical generalization; short 18-month timeframe may miss long-term outcomes. We address these through multiple comparison strategies, theory-guided pattern matching, triangulation across data sources, and transparent reporting of limitations.

## 4. FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE

### 4.1 Design Principles

The Federal Grant Compliance Framework (FGCF) follows seven design principles derived from implementation science, knowledge commons, and OER:

**P1: Modularity with Core Fidelity**. Organizations vary in size, capacity, and context. Framework modules can be adopted sequentially or selectively, but seven essential elements must be present for compliance integrity: all domains addressed (depth varies by need), regulatory accuracy maintained, documentation standards met, internal controls present, key personnel trained, monitoring/evaluation conducted, and continuous improvement practiced.

**P2: Progressive Disclosure**. Information overload prevents adoption. Three-tier structure provides: Quick Start (essential immediate actions), Standard Implementation (comprehensive full adoption), and Advanced Reference (deep detail for specialized situations). Based on cognitive load theory and educational scaffolding principles.

**P3: Evidence-Based & Regulation-Aligned**. Every requirement traces to specific regulatory citation (2 CFR 200, agency guidance). Expert review by grants professionals, auditors, and federal program officers ensures accuracy. Updates synchronize with regulatory changes.

**P4: Capacity-Appropriate**. Framework must work for resource-constrained organizations: no specialized software required (though integration guidance provided), plain language (Flesch-Kincaid grade 8-10), multiple format options, minimal cost burden through open access.

**P5: Implementation-Supported**. Framework alone is insufficient. Organizations receive implementation guidance following EPIS phases with self-assessment tools, planning templates, troubleshooting resources, and community platform for peer learning.

**P6: Measurable & Improvable**. Organizations need feedback on improvement; framework requires continuous enhancement. Compliance capacity self-assessment, checklist-based progress tracking, community feedback mechanisms, and regular review cycles enable both.

**P7: Openly Governed**. Knowledge commons approach requires community stewardship. Governance structure enables practitioner, researcher, and stakeholder participation in framework evolution while maintaining quality.

### 4.2 Seven-Domain Structure

The FGCF addresses seven documented deficiency categories:

**Domain 1: Financial Management & Reporting**
- Grant portfolio management system (centralized tracking)
- SEFA Builder (automated Schedule of Expenditures preparation)
- Budget monitoring and variance analysis
- Cost allocation methodology
- Cash management procedures

**Domain 2: Compliance Policies & Procedures**
- Uniform Guidance compliance policy (2 CFR 200 master policy)
- Allowable cost policy with decision tools
- Procurement policy (competition requirements, sole source)
- Time and effort reporting policy (PARs, certifications)
- Travel, conflict of interest, records retention, property management policies

**Domain 3: Eligibility Verification & Program Management**
- Eligibility determination framework (systematic verification)
- Participant file management (documentation organization)
- Service delivery documentation (proving grant-funded activities)

**Domain 4: Reporting & Performance Management**
- Reporting calendar with automated alerts
- Federal Financial Report (FFR/SF-425) preparation guide
- Performance report framework (logic models, indicators)
- Prior approval request management

**Domain 5: Subrecipient Monitoring**
- Subrecipient vs. contractor determination tool
- Risk assessment instrument
- Monitoring plan templates (desk reviews, site visits)
- Subaward agreement template with federal flow-down
- FFATA/FSRS reporting guide

**Domain 6: Audit Readiness & Internal Controls**
- Single Audit preparation guide (pre/during/post audit)
- Internal controls framework (COSO/Green Book based)
- Segregation of duties matrix
- Grant file organization system
- Close-out procedures checklist

**Domain 7: Training & Capacity Building**
- Role-based curricula (executive, grants administrator, finance, program staff, board)
- New employee onboarding
- Annual refresher training
- Reference library (annotated Uniform Guidance, FAQs, tutorials)
- Community of practice platform

Each domain includes: policy/procedure templates, implementation tools (spreadsheets, checklists, calculators), training materials, examples and case studies, and regulatory citations. Total deliverables: 120+ templates, tools, and resources.

### 4.3 Fidelity and Adaptation

Implementation science emphasizes balancing fidelity (using framework as designed) with adaptation (customizing to context). Following Stirman et al.'s (2019) FRAME (Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications):

**Core Elements (High Fidelity Required)**:
- All seven domains addressed
- Regulatory accuracy maintained
- Documentation at audit-defensible standards
- Basic internal controls present
- Key personnel trained
- Compliance monitoring conducted
- Annual policy review and continuous improvement

**Adaptable Elements**:
- Specific tools used (Excel vs. Google Sheets vs. integrated software)
- Policy language and format (organizational style)
- Training delivery methods (in-person, online, intensive, distributed)
- File organization specifics (physical, digital, naming conventions)
- Committee structures (dedicated vs. integrated)
- Reporting template formats (branding, internal sections)
- Risk assessment thresholds

Organizations document adaptations (what, when, why, by whom, to what level, fidelity impact) to contribute to framework learning about which modifications preserve versus undermine effectiveness.

### 4.4 Implementation Support

Following EPIS phases:

**Exploration (Weeks 1-4)**: Executive briefing, organizational readiness assessment (CFIR and AIF), needs prioritization, resource estimation, stakeholder engagement, go/no-go decision.

**Preparation (Weeks 5-12)**: Implementation team formation, planning, initial training, policy drafting, system setup, staff communication, baseline data collection.

**Implementation (Weeks 13-40)**: Pilot one domain (weeks 13-20), expand domains sequentially (weeks 21-32), integrate across domains (weeks 33-40) with continuous fidelity monitoring and adaptation documentation.

**Sustainment (Week 41+)**: Institutionalization into operations, quality monitoring (quarterly self-assessment), continuous improvement, staff turnover management, regulatory update integration.

Community support includes discussion forums, weekly office hours with experts, peer mentorship matching, monthly webinars, annual conference, shared resource library, and newsletter.

### 4.5 Technical Infrastructure and Open-Source Governance

**Platform**: GitHub repository with version control, issue tracking, pull request workflow. Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with tagged releases and comprehensive changelog.

**Website**: User-friendly portal with framework navigation, training modules, community forum, resource library, blog for updates, newsletter subscription.

**Licensing**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) enabling share, adapt, commercial use with attribution requirement. Maximally permissive while ensuring credit, compatible with OER 5Rs.

**Governance Structure** (Three-Tier):
- **Tier 1: Users** (anyone) access materials, provide feedback
- **Tier 2: Contributors** (active participants) submit improvements, vote on proposals, participate in working groups, receive recognition
- **Tier 3: Governing Council** (9-15 elected/appointed members: 40% practitioners, 20% researchers, 20% technical experts, 20% at-large) make final decisions on major changes, steward quality and mission, resolve conflicts, set strategic direction

**Decision Processes**: Routine decisions (minor edits, examples) via contributor consensus with 1-2 week review; significant additions (new domains, restructuring) via proposal → community comment (30 days) → Council vote; regulatory updates via expert subcommittee with expedited Council approval.

**Quality Assurance**: Annual framework review for regulatory currency and community feedback incorporation; expert advisory board reviews annually; rapid response protocol for regulatory changes.

**Contribution Guidelines**: Content improvements, tool development, training creation, translations, case studies, research, expertise sharing. Quality standards ensure regulatory accuracy, clarity, accessibility, coherence, and appropriate licensing.

**Sustainability**: Infrastructure costs $1,000-$3,000 annually (hosting, domain, email, video). Revenue models include institutional sponsorships (research grants, foundation grants, federal agency support), voluntary organizational contributions, optional fee-for-service (implementation consulting, customization, training delivery—revenues support infrastructure, services provided by consultants not required for framework access), and academic home providing institutional stability.

## 5. EVALUATION STRATEGY

### 5.1 Evaluation Questions

**Q1 (Utility)**: Does the FGCF improve compliance capacity and outcomes?
**Q2 (Process)**: How is the FGCF implemented, what facilitates or impedes adoption, and how is it adapted?
**Q3 (Mechanism)**: Which specific framework components and implementation strategies account for improvements?

### 5.2 Primary Outcomes

**Compliance Capacity**: FGCCA scores (0-100) measuring policy presence, system functionality, staff knowledge, documentation quality across seven domains. Administered at baseline (T0), 6 months (T1), 12 months (T2), 18 months sustainment (T3).

**Audit Findings**: For organizations with Single Audits, compare finding count, severity, types, questioned costs pre/post framework adoption. Analysis via McNemar's test for paired categorical data, t-tests for continuous measures.

**Secondary Outcomes**: Staff confidence (5-point scale), time burden (hours/week on compliance), reporting timeliness (% on-time), funding security (continuations, new awards).

### 5.3 Implementation Process Measures

**EPIS Phases**: Time spent, resources invested, completion of phase activities measured throughout implementation.

**Implementation Fidelity**: Percentage of core elements present, adaptation count and categorization via FRAME.

**CFIR Determinants**: Ratings at T0, T1 testing as predictors of adoption speed, quality, and outcomes via correlation and regression.

**AIF Drivers**: Competency, organization, and leadership driver ratings at T0, T1, T2 examining infrastructure changes and correlation with sustainment.

### 5.4 Expected Findings

Based on theory and pilot feasibility:

**H1 (Capacity Improvement)**: Organizations will show significant pre-post increases in FGCCA scores with medium-to-large effect sizes (d=0.50-0.80).

**H2 (Implementation Determinants)**: Higher baseline CFIR readiness scores will predict faster implementation and better fidelity (r>.40).

**H3 (Fidelity-Outcome Relationship)**: Implementation fidelity will positively correlate with compliance capacity gains (r>.50).

**H4 (Audit Improvements)**: Organizations with pre-implementation audit findings will show reduced finding counts and severity post-implementation.

**H5 (Sustainability)**: Presence of implementation drivers (AIF) will predict maintained framework use at 18-month follow-up.

### 5.5 Knowledge Contribution

Beyond outcome evaluation, qualitative analysis addresses:
- How do organizations adapt the framework, and which adaptations preserve versus undermine effectiveness?
- What implementation support mechanisms are most valuable?
- How does knowledge commons governance function in practice?
- What barriers and facilitators emerge in regulatory compliance contexts versus other implementation domains?
- What community participation patterns emerge, and how do they relate to framework quality evolution?

## 6. DISCUSSION

### 6.1 Theoretical Contributions

**To Implementation Science**: We extend CFIR, EPIS, and AIF to administrative compliance domains, a novel context. Regulatory compliance differs from clinical quality improvement or education reform in critical ways: external mandate versus voluntary adoption, legal consequences for non-compliance, limited discretion in adaptation. Our work tests whether implementation science frameworks apply in these constrained contexts and identifies needed modifications. For example, we hypothesize that "relative advantage" (CFIR construct) operates differently when baseline is legal risk rather than current practice quality.

**To Knowledge Commons Theory**: We apply GKC framework to public administration, extending beyond scientific research, software, and cultural domains. Regulatory contexts introduce unique tensions: accuracy requirements (errors have legal consequences), rapid obsolescence (regulations change), and heterogeneous community (practitioners, researchers, auditors, federal staff with different incentives). Our governance model addresses these through expert validation layers, expedited update procedures, and stakeholder diversity on governing council. We test whether Ostrom-derived design principles function in government-regulated domains.

**To Open Educational Resources**: We extend OER to professional compliance contexts where currency and accuracy are critical, not just pedagogical quality. Our governance model integrates expert validation with community contribution, proposing a hybrid approach balancing open participation with credential-based quality control. This addresses persistent OER challenge: maintaining quality in openly modifiable resources.

**Cross-Framework Integration**: We demonstrate combining multiple theoretical frameworks in coherent research design, showing how different theories address different implementation dimensions. This multi-framework approach aligns with calls from implementation science scholars (Nilsen, 2015; Tabak et al., 2012) but application remains limited.

### 6.2 Methodological Contributions

**Design Science Research with Open Governance**: We integrate DSR with knowledge commons governance, showing how community participation can be incorporated throughout artifact development and evaluation phases. This extends DSR beyond researcher-controlled artifact creation to community co-creation.

**Evaluation of Commons-Based Artifacts**: We propose mixed-methods evaluation combining traditional outcome assessment with process measures capturing community participation, contribution patterns, and governance dynamics. This addresses gap in knowledge commons literature: limited empirical evaluation of effectiveness and governance functioning.

**Open Science Practices**: Complete transparency in artifact development, community validation, open data (within privacy constraints), and open-source dissemination demonstrate open science principles in design science research.

### 6.3 Practical Contributions

**Immediately Usable Artifact**: Organizations can download and implement framework without cost or technical barriers, addressing documented need for accessible compliance resources.

**Evidence Base**: Systematic evaluation provides evidence on effectiveness, implementation process, and costs—currently lacking for compliance capacity-building interventions.

**Sustainable Infrastructure**: Knowledge commons governance model enables continuous improvement without dependency on commercial entities or single institutions.

**Scalable Model**: Approach could extend to other regulatory compliance domains (state grants, environmental regulations, healthcare compliance) or other public administration contexts requiring standardized yet adaptable frameworks.

### 6.4 Policy Implications

**For Federal Agencies**: Framework demonstrates feasibility of publicly accessible compliance infrastructure as alternative to requiring proprietary software or consultant engagements. Agencies could support framework maintenance as capacity-building investment with broad reach. OMB could reference framework in technical assistance guidance.

**For Funders**: Community foundations, corporate foundations, and capacity-building intermediaries could support framework adoption as effective, cost-efficient grantee capacity intervention. Evidence of effectiveness informs technical assistance priorities.

**For Professional Associations**: Grants management associations (NGMA, GPA) could integrate framework into certification programs, training curricula, and member resources, amplifying dissemination and contributing to governance.

**For Research Funders**: Framework provides example of research creating immediate practical value while advancing theory—model for publicly funded research producing public goods.

### 6.5 Limitations and Future Directions

**Limitations**: Pilot sample (n=12-15) limits generalizability and statistical power. Self-selection of volunteer organizations may overestimate effectiveness in broader population. Short timeframe (18 months) may miss long-term sustainability and impact. Non-experimental design constrains causal inference. Researcher involvement in development and evaluation introduces potential bias, mitigated through external evaluators and peer review.

**Future Research**:
1. **Larger-scale evaluation** with randomized or quasi-experimental design testing effectiveness across broader population
2. **Long-term impact study** examining sustained effects and multi-year audit outcomes
3. **Adaptation effectiveness** analysis determining which modifications preserve versus undermine outcomes
4. **Governance functioning** research examining community participation patterns, decision-making processes, and sustainability
5. **Cost-effectiveness analysis** comparing framework to commercial software and consulting alternatives
6. **Domain transfer** testing framework applicability to other compliance contexts (state grants, international development, healthcare, environmental)
7. **Technology integration** exploring complementary role with grant management software systems

### 6.6 Transferability to Other Domains

The approach developed here—integrating implementation science, knowledge commons, and OER to create openly governed compliance frameworks—could transfer to:
- **State and local grant compliance** (often similar requirements, fewer resources)
- **International development** (USAID, World Bank compliance)
- **Healthcare regulatory compliance** (HIPAA, Medicare/Medicaid requirements)
- **Environmental compliance** (EPA regulations for organizations)
- **Educational institutions** (Title IX, FERPA compliance)
- **Human subjects research** (IRB procedures, data security)

Key transferability conditions: (1) compliance requirements standardizable across organizations, (2) identifiable community with shared challenges, (3) public or semi-public good characteristics justifying open approach, (4) feasibility of expert validation without commercial incentives.

## 7. CONCLUSION

Federal grant recipients face systematic compliance challenges threatening both mission delivery and funding sustainability. Despite $1.2 trillion in annual federal funding and documented persistent failures, accessible, validated solutions remain absent. This paper proposes an open-source Federal Grant Compliance Framework addressing this gap through integration of implementation science, knowledge commons governance, and open educational resources principles.

Our contributions are threefold. **Theoretically**, we extend implementation science frameworks and knowledge commons theory to regulatory compliance contexts, testing applicability and identifying necessary adaptations. **Methodologically**, we demonstrate design science research integrated with open-source governance, proposing evaluation approaches for commons-based artifacts. **Practically**, we develop an immediately usable framework addressing documented compliance gaps while advancing scholarly understanding.

The framework embodies a different model: publicly funded research producing a public good; community governance enabling continuous improvement; and integration of practitioner wisdom, research evidence, and regulatory expertise. This contrasts with proprietary solutions inaccessible to resource-constrained organizations and with purely public-sector approaches lacking sustainability mechanisms.

Implementation science provides the foundation for adoptability; knowledge commons principles enable sustainable community stewardship; open educational resources ensure broad accessibility; and design science research provides rigorous methodology. Together, they create a framework that is theoretically grounded, empirically validated, freely accessible, continuously improving, and community governed.

The pilot evaluation will test effectiveness while examining implementation processes, adaptation patterns, and governance functioning. Findings will inform both framework refinement and theoretical understanding of implementation in regulatory contexts, knowledge commons in public administration, and OER governance in professional domains.

Beyond addressing immediate practical needs, this work demonstrates how publicly funded research can produce durable public goods when combined with appropriate governance structures. As public administration faces increasing complexity and nonprofits navigate growing regulatory burdens, the knowledge commons approach offers a sustainable path forward—one that leverages collective wisdom, maintains open access, and enables continuous adaptation while preserving quality.
